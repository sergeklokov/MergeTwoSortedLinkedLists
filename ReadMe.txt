In many examples on the internet, developers write their own LinkedList calss, and Node class, with Next pointer
I decided to use pre-existing c# Linked List class, however because it is Double Linked List in fact, 
I will use it only one-way, like real Linked List.

Output:
4 8 15 19 20
7 9 16 16
4 7 8 9 15 16 16 19 20
4 7 8 9 15 16 16 19 20
Press any key..
